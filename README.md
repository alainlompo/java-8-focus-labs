# java-8-focus-labs

<h3> exploring java 8 core enhancements </h3>
<br/>
The following aspects of java 8 enhancements are covered in the examples of the project
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>The use of default keyword in interfaces to implements method bodies that an implementing class
  may choose not to implement. One important aspect of it is providing forward (and not backward) compatibility of legacy code with java 8</li>
  <li>The use of the <b>::</b> operator in filtering arrays and collections datas </li>
  <li>The use of lambdas expressions in various cases (such as sorting an array with <i>Arrays.sort</i> method</li>
  <li>the use of generic predicates as function value parameters allowing a value reference to boolean functions</li>
  <li>the use of the java 8 Stream object along with its filter and collect method</li>
  <li>Aggregating filtered datas from a stream with the use of <b>Collectors.groupingBy</b> method</li>
</ul>
<br/>
